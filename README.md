PoziWorld Elf
=======


PoziWorld Elf lets you use your voice to control things you usually use your mouse and/or keyboard for.

Not many commands are supported at the moment, but more are on the way.

Elf is not a standalone app, it works by sending commands to partner extensions installed in your browser (the Google Chrome, Opera, or another Chromium-based browser).
